# Intro to Python: Testing Basic Scripts

This homework contains 2 python scripts completing the following exercises:

1. Using nested for loops and if statements, write a program that iterates over every integer from 3 to 100 (inclusive) and prints out the number only if it is a prime number.

2. Create three lists containing 10 integers each. The first list should contain all the integers sequentially from 1 to 10 (inclusive). The second list should contain the squares of each element in the first list. The third list should contain the cubes of each element in the first list. Print all three lists side-by-side in three columns. E.g. the first row should contain 1, 1, 1 and the second row should contain 2, 4, 8.
