# Accessing Meteorite Landing Data with Redis and Flask

In this project, we are given one data set containing a multitude of meteorite landing site data to work with. Our goal is to containerize and launch a Redis database server that we can both load data to and retrieve data from using a Flask application that we will containerize using a Dockerfile. With the prevalence of large sets of data in our modern age, having a reliable method to store all of that data is important. Equivallently, having a method that updates, loads, and retrieves that data when necessary is just as important. As such, this project aims to solve these core issues using a Redis database and Flask application to facilitate the storage and retrieval of data from large data sets like these.

## Downloading Data Set

Before we can start utilizing these methods, we need to first download the meteorite landing site data that we're going to be working with in a desired directory. In order to do that, simply run the following command in your command line terminal within your desired directory:
```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wjallen/coe332-sample-data/main/ML_Data_Sample.json
```

## Launch Redis Database

In order to containerize and launch your Redis database, we need to first make sure we have redis installed. To do so, execute the command shown below:
```
pip3 install --user redis
```
As we seek to launch our containerized instance using the stock redis:6 image, we also need to make sure we execute the following command to pull that image:
```
docker pull redis:6
```
Once that is done, we can finally launch our containerized Redis database server. We want to connect our assigned Redis port to the default Redis port and have it save 1 backup file every second to a /data folder. We can do all of that by executing this command:
```
docker run -d -p <redis-port#>:6379 -v $(pwd)/data:/data:rw --name=<your-name>-redis redis:6 --save 1 1
```
NOTE: Be sure to replace `<redis-port#>` with your own/assigned redis port and `<your-name>` with your name.

You can check if it is up and running with `docker ps -a`, which should output a table of the format displayed below.
```
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE      COMMAND                  CREATED         STATUS             PORTS                                                         NAMES
(Container ID) redis:6    "docker-entrypoint.sâ€¦"   (time created)  Up (time created)  0.0.0.0:<redis-port#>->6379/tcp, :::<redis-port#>->6379/tcp   "container-name"
```
You should see your container with the name you gave it on the table generated with the STATUS as Up and the port you assigned it.

If any of the above is not found, you can try to debug it using: 
```
docker logs "container-name"
```

## Pull/Build/Launch Flask Application

In order to use the Flask application, we first start off by pulling it from Dockerhub using the following command:
```
docker pull <username>/<code>:<version>
```
- To specifically pull mine, replace `<username>/<code>:<version>` with `etchi17/flask-ml-data-sample:hw5`

```
docker build -t etchi17/flask-ml-data-sample:hw5 .
```
```
docker run --name "etchi17-hw5" -d -p 5007:5000 etchi17/flask-ml-data-sample:hw5
```
```
