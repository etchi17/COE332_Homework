# Accessing Meteorite Landing Data with Redis and Flask

In this project, we are given one data set containing a multitude of meteorite landing site data to work with. Our goal is to containerize and launch a Redis database server that we can both load data to and retrieve data from using a Flask application that we will containerize using a Dockerfile. With the prevalence of large sets of data in our modern age, having a reliable method to store all of that data is important. Equivallently, having a method that updates, loads, and retrieves that data when necessary is just as important. As such, this project aims to solve these core issues using a Redis database and Flask application to facilitate the storage and retrieval of data from large data sets like these.
